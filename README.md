# Unsupervised-Learning

NJ Transit is the second-largest commuter rail network in the United States by ridership; it spans New Jersey and connects the state to New York City. On the Northeast Corridor, the busiest passenger rail line in the United States, Amtrak also operates passenger rail service; together, NJ Transit and Amtrak operate nearly 750 trains across the NJ Transit rail network.
The main focus of this project is to dive into transit's dataset and design an unsupervised learning model to group the trains accordingly based on corresponding delay time and stop sequences.
